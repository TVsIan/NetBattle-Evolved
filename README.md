# NetBattle Evolved

## Goal:
To update NetBattle into something that runs in a more modern computing & networking environment.

The first task will be minor updates from 0.9.6 to an 0.9.7 (aka NetBattle Classic) that changes the hardcoded server address to a new one, adds a user override in the event that goes down, and makes the password system more secure.

After that, taking steps to make it more usable on current and future machines, possibly a web-based application. And switching the server/client structure to something more API-based.
